# Loan-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Algoritm

With the increment in financial area many individuals are applying for loans in bank. All the loans are not approvable. The fundamental income of bank resources comes from gain acquired from loans. The main objective of banks is to invest their assets in safe customers. Today many banks approve loan after many process of verification and validation but still there is no surety that selected customer is safe or not. Therefore it is important to apply different strategies in financial area for choosing a client who pays loan on schedule. In this report we use Logistic Regression algorithm and Support Vector Machine for the classification of data. Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine algorithm builds a model from trained dataset and this model is applied on test data we have and we get the required output.
